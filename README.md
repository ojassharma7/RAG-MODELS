# RAG-MODELS

RAG Techniques Comparison
Overview
This project explores and compares different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to evaluate their performance across multiple metrics, including accuracy, latency, and resource usage. The models leverage a combination of information retrieval and text generation to improve performance on knowledge-intensive tasks like Question Answering (QA).

This repository contains the implementation, evaluation, and comparison of various RAG approaches, including:

RAG-Token
RAG-Sequence
RAG-End-to-End
RAG-Fusion
RAG-Hybrid
The goal is to determine which technique offers the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for specific use cases.

RAG Techniques
In this project, we compare the following RAG models:

RAG-Token: Retrieves documents at every token generation step, providing high granularity.
RAG-Sequence: Retrieves documents at the sequence level, which is faster but less fine-tuned.
RAG-End-to-End: Jointly fine-tunes both retrieval and generation for optimal performance.
RAG-Fusion: Retrieves multiple documents and synthesizes them during generation.
RAG-Hybrid: Combines dense and sparse retrieval mechanisms for improved document retrieval.
